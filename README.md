# Introduction

The scope of my work is to create the prototype of a system to extract interesting _Trigger Conditions_ from malwares.

Inside the repository, I will place both the developing prototype and the code (real world, or PoC by me) used to test its functionalities. 

Malwares will preminently be written in C++ language, for the Windows 7/10 OS, x86 (32-bit) architecture.
